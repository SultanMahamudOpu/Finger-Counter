# 🚀 AI-Powered Finger Counter Using Python! 🤖✋

Excited to share my latest project – a real-time AI-powered finger counter that accurately detects and counts fingers using Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe! 🎉

🔹 Features:
✅ Detects fingers from one or both hands
✅ Real-time tracking with smooth performance
✅ Uses computer vision & deep learning for accurate results
✅ Can be extended for gesture recognition & interactive applications

Building this system was an incredible learning experience, combining image processing, machine learning, and real-time computer vision! 🔥

Would love to hear your thoughts! How do you think this technology can be used in real-world applications? Let's discuss in the comments! ⬇️
